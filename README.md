<h1>Github Addition</h1>
Beat Clicker is a game made for the 2024 Rhythm Game Jam!
This upload is much in the future from the release of the game, but I wanted to provide an upload as a record of sorts and forgot about doing that up until right now.
<h2>How To Download</h1>


<h2>Beat Clicker (Rhythm Jam 2024)</h2>
<p>Beat Clicker is my first game ever completed, as well as my first game jam ever participated in!</p>
<p>Beat Clicker is a rhythm game where you move your player along three tracks to hit notes on beat, partially inspired by the Muffet boss fight from Undertale.</p>
<p>Move between three tracks to hit the notes on time, or dodge the barriers that appear on the track. Make sure you hold on the hold notes!<br></p>
<h3>!! DIFFICULTY WARNING !!</h3>
<p>I've been advised to put this here by several people, I was the only one who play-tested through the week so I didn't realize how difficult the game was until the last night of the jam when I had other people play it. Too late to fix, I hope this warning works instead :)</p>
<p>AFTER RELEASE UPDATE: I genuinely believe that hard mode Vergence is impossible to full combo. I can see someone doing the easy mode, maybe even the medium mode. If you somehow end up full combo-ing Vergence on hard mode (or even beating it with the health modifier) please share it, I would love to watch :)<br></p>
<h3>CONTROLS</h3>
<ul><li>W and S to move up and down tracks respectively</li><li>Use both left click and right click to hit notes, with space bar and enter being options as well</li></ul>
